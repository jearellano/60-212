INTRODUCTION
------------

Completed Assignments&Laboratories 1 - 10 for Object Oriented Programming, 60-212, University Of Windsor 
 
Laboratory 1: Prime Number 
------------

Your Java program must
a) Include an integer called, say, numberSupplied with a specifed value
c) Compute the first prime number greater than numberSupplied.
d) Display the results to the user 

Laboratory 2: Strings
------------

Write a Java application which
 reads in a line of text, with 0 or more leading blanks and with 0 or more trailing
blanks, using nextLine() method to read the entire line of text using a single
method call.
 displays the words in the line that you read in. You should have one word in each
line you display. You must use StringTokenizer class to do this.
 displays the longest word in the line.
 displays the total number of vowels in the line you read in. (Hint: The vowel
may be in lower case or in upper case)

Laboratory 3: User Defined Class
------------

To create a new user-defined class with specified fields and methods. The class has to
be tested using a Java application that we have supplied.
 Use the StringTokenizer to parse the name given as a string.

Laboratory 4: Inheritance 
------------

Learn casting and inheritance.

Laboratory 5: Polymorphism and Abstract Classes
------------

Learning Fundamentals of Polymorphism and Abstract Classes, how much simplier code can become.  


Laboratory 6: Interface,Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods
------------

This work is closely related to the classes you wrote in Laboratory 5. You should modify
those classes as discussed below.

Laboratory 7: JFrame And Event Handlers
------------

The user has to repeatedly specify an integer number in the JTextField object next to the
label “Input” followed by an operation (+, -, *, /). The calculator has an internal variable
which stores the result of the last operation. Initially, the value of this variable will be 0. 

Laboratory 9: Linked Lists
------------
Consider class ListGeneral available on the web. Show how you may to define a class
called SortedListOfInt that allows you to create and traverse a sorted linked list of
objects, where successive objects contain an integer with non-decreasing values. The
class SortedListOfInt should include an object of ListGeneral. This object of class
ListGeneral should be used to maintain the linked list of Integer objects

Laboratory 10: Exceptions
------------
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException – If a user tries to enter more elements than the length of the
array numbers
NumberFormatException – If the user enters anything other than an integer in inputArea.
DivideByZeroException – If the user tries to find the average of all elements in array numbers
before any integers have been stored into it. 

Assignment 1: Trivial Programming
------------

In cryptarithmetic puzzles, mathematical equations are written using letters. Each letter
corresponds to a digit from 0 to 9 but no two letters can be the same. Here is a sample
problem:
SEND + MORE = MONEY
A solution to the puzzle is S = 9, R = 8, O = 0, M = 1, Y = 2, E = 5, N = 6 and D = 7.
Write a program that finds a solution to the puzzle of
TOO + TOO + TOO + TOO = GOOD

Assignment 2: Strings 
------------

Develop a Java application that
 reads an input string (see example below) representing grades obtained by a
student,
 computes the average grade as a percentile.
Example of input supplied to the application:
(24/25) ;( 40/ 80); (91) ; (22/ 25)


Assignment 3: Objects
------------
You have to define two classes as follows:
o A class called Name with the following methods and variables given
below. This class is similar to the MyDate class you are writing in Lab 3.

Assignment 4: Inheritance 
------------
You have to define a new class called Manager by extending class NewWorker 

Assignment 5: Grocery List 
------------

Define a list of classes to handle the case of different food items handled by a grocery as
described below

Assignment 6: Interface, Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods
------------

Assignment 7: JFrame and Event Handlers
------------
In this assignment, you will deal with classes CanadianStudent,CanadianStudentUnder65, ForeignStudent and
interface FeeCalculator and Sortable. You have defined one version of these classes in Assignment 6. In this
assignment, you will modify these classes to some extent and use it to learn Frames, events, and anonymous
classes to handle events. Class Assignment7Tester, and class OutputFrame are available on the course website
which you will use in this assignmrent. My solution to Assignment 6 will be available after the deadline for the
assignmrent.

Assignment 9: Linked Lists with generic types and iterators 
------------

Consider the class ListGeneral available on the web which was discussed in class. This uses a
stand-alone Node class where each object of the Node class has private instance variables value
and next of classes Object and Node respectively. You have to define two classes ListGeneric and
SearchableList as follows: 

Assignment 10: Exception and Arraylist
------------

Our objective is to develop an information system that allows us to i) store a
number of (key, value) pairs, and ii) retrieve information from such a system by
specifying the contents of key. You may assume that a given key value appears at
most once in the information system
