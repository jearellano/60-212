INTRODUCTION
------------

Completed Assignments&Laboratories 1 - 10 for Object Oriented Programming, 60-212, University Of Windsor 
 
Laboratory 1: Prime Number 
------------

Your Java program must
a) Include an integer called, say, numberSupplied with a specifed value
c) Compute the first prime number greater than numberSupplied.
d) Display the results to the user 

Laboratory 2: Strings
------------

Write a Java application which
 reads in a line of text, with 0 or more leading blanks and with 0 or more trailing
blanks, using nextLine() method to read the entire line of text using a single
method call.
 displays the words in the line that you read in. You should have one word in each
line you display. You must use StringTokenizer class to do this.
 displays the longest word in the line.
 displays the total number of vowels in the line you read in. (Hint: The vowel
may be in lower case or in upper case)

Laboratory 3: User Defined Class
------------

To create a new user-defined class with specified fields and methods. The class has to
be tested using a Java application that we have supplied.
 Use the StringTokenizer to parse the name given as a string.

Laboratory 4: Inheritance 
------------

Learn casting and inheritance.

Laboratory 5: Polymorphism and Abstract Classes
------------

Learning Fundamentals of Polymorphism and Abstract Classes, how much simplier code can become.  


Laboratory 6: Interface,Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods
------------

This work is closely related to the classes you wrote in Laboratory 5. You should modify
those classes as discussed below.

Laboratory 7: JFrame And Event Handlers
------------

The user has to repeatedly specify an integer number in the JTextField object next to the
label “Input” followed by an operation (+, -, *, /). The calculator has an internal variable
which stores the result of the last operation. Initially, the value of this variable will be 0. 

Laboratory 9: Linked Lists
------------
Consider class ListGeneral available on the web. Show how you may to define a class
called SortedListOfInt that allows you to create and traverse a sorted linked list of
objects, where successive objects contain an integer with non-decreasing values. The
class SortedListOfInt should include an object of ListGeneral. This object of class
ListGeneral should be used to maintain the linked list of Integer objects

Laboratory 10: Exceptions
------------
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException – If a user tries to enter more elements than the length of the
array numbers
NumberFormatException – If the user enters anything other than an integer in inputArea.
DivideByZeroException – If the user tries to find the average of all elements in array numbers
before any integers have been stored into it. 
// Assignments involving Generics and array lists etc are all made available in git hub repo 60-212
