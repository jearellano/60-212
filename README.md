Completed Assignments 1 - 5 for Intro To Programming And Algorithms 2, 60-141, University Of Windsor 
 
Assignment 1: Reverse Number Magic Sequence 
------------

In order to generate a magic number, we reverse a given original number and store the absolute value
of the difference between the original number and its reversed version. For example, given the number
476, we will generate the reverse number 674 and then compute the absolute value of the difference
between 476 and 674 to be 198. We then reverse 198 to display the number 891; we call that the magic
number! Compute Magic numbers of a given sequence.Calculates the difference between a given number and 
its reverse version. 

Assignment 2: 2D Array Manipulation 
------------

Code each of the functions specified below>> 
void PopulateArray2DUnique(int A[][COL], unsigned int rowsize, unsigned int colsize, int min, int max);
void DisplayArray2D(int A[][COL], unsigned int rowsize, unsigned int colsize);
int FindLargest(int A[][COL], unsigned int rowsize, unsigned int colsize);
int FindColSum(int A[][COL], unsigned int rowsize, unsigned int colsize, unsigned int col_to_sum);
int Sort2DArray(int A[][COL], unsigned int rowsize, unsigned int colsize);
int CopyArray2D(int A[][COL], int B[][COL], unsigned int rowsize, unsigned int colsize);

Assignment 3: Pointers And Strings
------------

Given some text input, you are to find the largest anagram groups.
A text is a sequence of words. A word w is an anagram of a word v if and only if there is some
permutation p of character positions that takes w to v. Then, w and v are in the same anagram group.
The size of an anagram group is the number of words in that group. Find the 5 largest anagram groups.
Terminates by the word "STOP", sort groups in decreasing size. 

Assignment 4: Structures 
------------

An event can be described using a time stamp and a string. For example: “09:30 Dental appointment” is
an example of an event that has an hour and a minute, as well as a short description.
For simplicity let’s assume all events happen on the same day, so there is no need to maintain a date.
Also assume that the hours are between 0 and 23 inclusive, where the day starts at hour 0 (i.e.
midnight) and 2pm is 14, etc. Assume also that the minute is between 0 and 59 inclusive. Finally, assume
that the description string can hold up to 40 usable characters.

Assignment 5: Dynamic Linked Lists
------------

Similar to the previous assignment, we will reuse the same structure with minor modifications.
An event can be described using a time stamp and a string. For example: “09:30 Dental appointment” is
an example of an event that has an hour and a minute, as well as a short description.
For simplicity let’s assume all events happen in the same day, so no need to maintain a date. Also
assume that the hours are between 0 and 23 inclusive, where the day starts at hour 0 (i.e. midnight) and
2pm is 14, etc. Assume also that the minute is between 0 and 59 inclusive. Finally, assume that the
string can hold up to 40 usable characters.
